## Initial chat message
I added a new document: @ARCHITECTURE-FINAL.md 

Review cursor rules, cursor skills, readme.md, and update as needed. Remove the old @ARCHITECTURE.md and refer to this one intead.

## Context
Switched the project to use ARCHITECTURE-FINAL.md as the canonical architecture document and aligned supporting tooling and documentation with it. This focuses on architecture documentation and guidance rather than runtime code changes.

## What was done
- Added `ARCHITECTURE-FINAL.md` containing the final, detailed architecture for the OMG backend.
- Updated `README.md` to reference `ARCHITECTURE-FINAL.md` as the canonical architecture doc and clarified the architecture summary.
- Updated Cursor rules (`architecture-ddd.mdc`, `core-project.mdc`) to point at `ARCHITECTURE-FINAL.md` for layering and workflow guidance.
- Updated the `omg-architecture-explainer` skill and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` so agents and Copilot respect the architecture described in `ARCHITECTURE-FINAL.md`.
- Removed the obsolete `ARCHITECTURE.md` file while leaving historical session logs intact.
- Committed and pushed the documentation and rule changes (`845cbd0` on branch `main`).

## Design decisions
- Chose to treat `ARCHITECTURE-FINAL.md` as the single source of truth for architecture, keeping README as a concise summary.
- Preserved historical references to `ARCHITECTURE.md` in existing session logs to maintain an accurate record of past work.
- Accepted skipping `dotnet test` for this finalize step because the repository does not yet contain a .NET solution or test projects, and only documentation/rule files were modified.
