## Context
Finalize workflow for the initial OMG - Open Modular Gardening repository setup, committing the Cursor configuration, README, user stories, initial session log, and .gitignore, before any application code or tests are added.

## What was done
- Staged all current project files, including `.cursor` rules and skills, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and the first session log in `doc/`.
- Created the initial git commit with a message derived from the repository setup conversation: `chore(repo): bootstrap OMG setup`.
- Pushed the new `main` branch to the remote repository on GitHub.
- Skipped running tests because no .NET solution, code, or test projects exist yet, which is expected at this stage of the case.

## Design decisions
- Treated the repository bootstrap (Cursor config, documentation, gitignore) as a coherent unit of work worth capturing in a single initial commit.
- Chose a `chore(...)`-style commit prefix to indicate non-feature, non-domain behavior, focused on project scaffolding and developer experience.
- Explicitly documented the absence of tests and code in this session log so reviewers understand why the finalize flow did not include a test step.
