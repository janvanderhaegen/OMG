# OMG - Open Modular Gardening – Session Log

## Context
Initial setup of the OMG - Open Modular Gardening backend repository for the engineering case, with a focus on Cursor configuration, documentation, and user story definition rather than implementation code.

## What was done
- Read and interpreted the engineering case for the Open Modular Gardening backend.
- Defined a global Cursor rule in `.cursor/rules/core-project.mdc` to enforce session logging into `doc/` and give lightweight project-wide guidance.
- Created the `note-a-session-logging` project skill to standardize how agentic work sessions are summarized and stored as markdown in `doc/`.
- Created the `note-a-finalize-commit` project skill to handle “finalize/commit” requests by generating commit messages from conversation context, running tests, committing, pushing, and then logging the session.
- Drafted and added `README.md` with a short project description, Cursor usage note, an architecture stub, and the ordered list of user stories.
- Re-ordered and finalized user stories US01–US22 into a logical execution-flow sequence with bonus scope clearly marked per story.

## Design decisions
- Chose to represent each Cursor-driven session as a separate markdown file named `YYYY-MM-DD-session-XXX.md` to make the development history easy to scan by date and sequence.
- Represented Cursor usage explicitly in the README to make AI involvement in the project clear to reviewers.
- Separated responsibilities into two skills: one focused solely on session logging and another focused on the end-to-end finalize/commit workflow (tests, git, and documentation).
- Defined user stories in execution-flow order starting with repository and architecture work (US01–US03) so that the backlog itself tells a narrative of how the system will be built.
