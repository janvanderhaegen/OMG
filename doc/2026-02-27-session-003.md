## Context
Implemented the Garden Management bounded context for gardens end-to-end, including domain model, messaging contracts, API endpoints, health checks, runtime wiring, and tests. Finalized the work by adding an initial EF Core migration, Aspire/docker-compose configuration adjustments, and documentation updates.

## What was done
- Added OMG.Management.Domain, OMG.Management.Infrastructure, and OMG.Messaging.Contracts projects with a rich Garden aggregate, domain events, value objects, and integration events.
- Implemented ManagementDbContext, GardenEntity, soft-delete support, EF Core configuration (including global query filter), and an InitialManagementCreate migration.
- Integrated MassTransit and RabbitMQ with a generic IGardenIntegrationEventPublisher that maps domain events to specific integration events.
- Implemented resource-oriented garden management endpoints (list, get, create, update, delete) with intent-revealing domain methods (Rename, ChangeSurfaceArea, ChangeTargetHumidity, MarkDeleted).
- Enhanced the health endpoint to verify database connectivity and wired ManagementDbContext, repository, unit-of-work, and messaging into Program, including dev-time migrations/EnsureCreated-or-Migrate logic.
- Updated ARCHITECTURE-FINAL.md and README.md to document domain events vs integration events, REST vs domain actions, soft-delete strategy, and dev-time schema management.
- Added domain tests for Garden behaviors and API integration tests for all garden management endpoints, then ran the full test suite successfully and committed/pushed the changes.
