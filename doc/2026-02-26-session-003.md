## Context
Set up the initial architecture and AI-assisted development workflow for the OMG backend, including .NET runtime decisions, DDD layering, Cursor rules/skills, and Copilot customization with Awesome Copilot resources.

## What was done
- Documented the target architecture in `README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`, standardizing on .NET 10, ASP.NET Core minimal APIs, and a Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Api layering.
- Added new Cursor rules for architecture/DDD, minimal APIs, testing strategy, and runtime orchestration (Docker/.NET Aspire), and strengthened the core project rule file.
- Created new Cursor skills for architecture explanation, test scaffolding, and runtime orchestration review to guide future agent sessions.
- Added Copilot configuration files (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `COPILOT-SETUP.md`) that integrate Awesome Copilot guidance for C#, ASP.NET REST APIs, DDD, Docker, and DevOps/CI.
- Updated session logging and workflow rules so every agentic session is tied to specific user stories and recorded under `doc/YYYY-MM-DD-session-XXX.md`.
- Documented a phased rollout plan for Docker/docker-compose and .NET Aspire orchestration in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Design decisions
- Chose .NET 10 (`net10.0`) and ASP.NET Core minimal APIs as the default stack for the backend to keep the service modern and lightweight.
- Adopted a DDD-oriented modular monolith with explicit layer boundaries to keep business rules isolated and testable.
- Decided to encode key architecture, testing, and runtime expectations directly into `.cursor/rules/` and `.cursor/skills/` so Cursor agents consistently follow the same conventions.
- Integrated Awesome Copilot at the instruction/agent level via documentation and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, rather than copying all remote content into the repo, to keep the setup lean while still leveraging community best practices.

## Next steps
- Scaffold the initial .NET solution and ASP.NET minimal API project (health endpoint, US03) following the documented architecture and rules.
- Introduce an initial Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` aligned with the runtime orchestration rules once the API project exists.
- Start implementing core user stories (e.g., garden and plant CRUD, US05–US10) with domain-first modeling and tests guided by the new testing strategy and skills.
