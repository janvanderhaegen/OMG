# Core Project Rules

## Session logging

- After each meaningful agentic work session, create a markdown summary file in `doc/`.
- **Filename pattern**: `doc/YYYY-MM-DD-session-XXX.md`, where:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD` is the current date.
  - `XXX` is a three-digit sequence for that day starting from `001`.
- Each session log must use the following structure:

  ```markdown
  # OMG - Open Modular Gardening – Session Log

  - Date: YYYY-MM-DD
  - Time: HH:MM (local)
  - Related user stories: USxx, ...

  ## Context
  [Short description of what this session was about.]

  ## What was done
  [Bullet list of key changes and activities.]

  ## Design decisions
  [Non-trivial choices, trade-offs, or assumptions.]

  ## Next steps
  [Concrete follow-ups, TODOs, or open questions.]
  ```

- Focus on **intent, reasoning, and decisions**, not low-level code diffs.
- Assume reviewers will read these logs to understand how Cursor was used during this case.

## Coding and workflow guidelines

- Favor small, focused changes that map clearly to user stories (US01–US22). Each agentic session and related changes should reference at least one USxx in the session log.
- Keep documentation and comments concise and practical.
- Treat the target runtime as **.NET 10** (`net10.0`) and the primary HTTP layer as **ASP.NET Core minimal APIs**, following the architecture described in `ARCHITECTURE-FINAL.md`.
- Respect the `Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Api` layering and DDD guidance in `architecture-ddd.mdc`.
- Prefer adding or updating automated tests when introducing new business rules, following `testing-strategy.mdc`.
- When adding runtime configuration or containerization, follow `runtime-orchestration.mdc`.
- When the user explicitly asks to **finalize** or **commit** work, follow the dedicated finalize/commit skill rather than ad-hoc git commands.
